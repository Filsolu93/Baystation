An interface for those with children and local child care providers, Babysitter aims to connect those in need with those who care. Parents can schedule and post babysitting jobs online and find qualified, vetted, and experienced babysitters in their area. Browse caregiver profiles, read reviews, and communicate directly with caregivers to find the best one for the job.

Caregivers can create a profile, browse, and apply for available babysitting jobs. Over time, caregivers can build a portfolio of completed work with positive reviews to build brand and reputation in their community enabling them to secure more jobs and higher pay..

Motivation
As a father of 3 small children and living in a small college town, it's always a challenge to find childcare. You need a way to expand the number of people you know. At the same time, those who want to babysit need to do the same to increase their income and job quality. They say, "quality comes out quantity."

This app should help these two groups of peole find each other much easier.
